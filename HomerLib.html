<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>The Homer Library facilitates the education and entertainment of library patrons through materials owned by the library and those provided by the interlibrary loan system.<br>
The Homer Library serves everyone in the Heritage School District. If you reside or own property within the city limits of Homer, your tax dollars help support the Library and you are eligible for a free library card. Residents in the township, Broadlands, Allerton, Longview or otherwise in the Heritage School District may subscribe to the library for $37 per year. Just visit the Library in person and present acceptable identification showing your name and current address.</p>
<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>The Homer Community Library offers a wide range of programs and services. The Library carries over 12,000 volumes of books for adults and children, large-print books, audiobooks, music, movies, puzzles and magazines. We also provide free books for elementary school students through the Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) program.<br>
The Library offers public computers with wireless internet, word processing, graphic design, presentation, photo retouching and spreadsheet software and printing and copying services. See the librarian for additional information.<br>
The Library is part of the Lincoln Trails Libraries System (LTLS). Your library card provides access to all of the libraries in the LTLS. If you cannot find a specific title in the Library, ask the librarian to borrow that material from another library for you. Or, you can borrow items by accessing the LINC catalog on the LTLS webpage. Inquire at the Library if you have any questions.<br>
Board meetings are open to the public, take place at 7:00 pm on the second Tuesday of each month, and are held in the Library.</p>
