Umaru Doma high school girl who on the surface appears to be perfect with beautiful looks, top grades, and excellence in everything she does. 
However, at home, she reverts to a secret lifestyle where she wears a hamster hoodie, acts lazy, eats junk food, and is obsessed with playing video games, reading manga, and watching anime. 
While she is in this "indoor" mode, she is drawn in a chibi manner, later calling herself Komaru (Umaru's little sister) when Kirie Motoba catches her in that persona. 
She lives with her older brother Taihei. She wears a cap when she goes to the video arcade where she is a well-known gamer who goes by the initials UMR. 
She later dons a mask to hide her identity from Sylphynford.
