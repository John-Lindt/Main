FB Page Audit:
Update story. Why are you a larger than life force people should trust? Make verbage more straight-forward. Need new picture and cover photo.
People can't spell Brigitte. Make sure it's plainly displayed throughout the page.
Add yourself as a team member.
Change category from photographer to marketing and videography
Pull key photos from IG to FB timeline
Renew wedding photographer job posting
Language in longer posts needs a clean up. Often sounds robotic.
Get a client testimonial (preferably video) and prominently display it.
Cover photo needs some verbage/tag line (maybe ACE formula)
